# ecell_web
This is a Project given by the E-cell of our college as a task to the students to judge their frontend skills as well as their efficiency and catch on github.

In this prohect we have created a basic page where we make 3 rectangular sections one with a color, one with E-cell logo and the last one with 3 x 3 grids.
The last one consists of some functioning and that is when the grid boxes are clicked they change their color and when the last box is clcked they retain back their color in the order they were clicked.
Thanks to the E-cell of our college for giving us such a opportunity.
